# shadeai

### what is shade? 
  + shade is a tool that allows you to interact with your system (macOS for now) like never before

### i am not the original creator
  + first things first; while i think that the idea for allowing AI to be more functional and to some extent modular shade is built off th work done by Erik Bjareholt with his project here: [gptme](https://github.com/ErikBjare/gptme).
  + i have simply added the tools and done some light customization with the ui and cli.

### this is an experimental project
  + given that this allows shade to work on your system my personal recommendation is to only use this in a VM or old mac you dont mind getting bricked.
  + i haven't given the tools i designed the ability to take **full** action but rather complete what it can before needing you to hit send, confirm, submit etc.
  + if you do choose to use this on your daily driver i would recommend changing to a provider like ollama which is supported here. just be sure to define the model in the -m tag as the local provider: example: `gptme --model local/ollama/llama3.2:1b "hello"`
